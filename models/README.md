## **Load Models**

**Dificult to upload model large file**

The GitHub limit file fize is 100MB. So to upload the model to github I created functions to compress and decompress the pickle file and make it possible.
You can find the code and instructions [**here**](load_models.py). Also see the code comments to understand what is going on.
